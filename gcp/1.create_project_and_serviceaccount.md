Creating the Terraform Project and Service Account

In this lesson, we create a service account and configuration file for our GCP environment through Terraform.

How to copy the key from your local machine to the Linux Academy server:

scp terraform-key.json cloud_user@'ipaddress':~

The environment I'm using locally is a MAC OS.

template:

provider "google" {
  version = "3.5.0"

  credentials = file("<NAME>.json")

  project = "<PROJECT_ID>"
  region  = "us-central1"
  zone    = "us-central1-c"
}

resource "google_compute_network" "vpc_network" {
  name = "terraform-network"
}
